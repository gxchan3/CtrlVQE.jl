    Qubit(q)

The component of the static Hamiltonian which is local to qubit `q`.

For example, in a transmon device,
    `Qubit(2)` represents a term ``ω_q a_q'a_q - δ_q/2~ a_q'a_q'a_q a_q``.

"""

end

"""
    Coupling(), aka COUPLING

The components of the static Hamiltonian which are non-local to any one qubit.

For example, in a transmon device,
    `Coupling()` represents the sum ``∑_{p,q} g_{pq} (a_p'a_q + a_q'a_p)``.

"""

const COUPLING = Coupling()

"""
    Uncoupled(), aka UNCOUPLED

The components of the static Hamiltonian which are local to each qubit.

This represents the sum of each `Qubit(q)`,
    where `q` iterates over each qubit in the device.

For example, in a transmon device,
    `Uncoupled()` represents the sum ``∑_q (ω_q a_q'a_q - δ_q/2~ a_q'a_q'a_q a_q)``.

"""
struct Uncoupled <: StaticOperator end

"""
    Static(), aka STATIC

All components of the static Hamiltonian.

This represents the sum of `Uncoupled()` and `Coupled()`

"""
    Channel(i,t)

An individual drive term (indexed by `i`) at a specific time `t`.

For example, in a transmon device,
    `Channel(q,t)` might represent ``Ω_q(t) [\\exp(iν_qt) a_q + \\exp(-iν_qt) a_q']``,
    the drive for a single qubit.

Note that you are free to have multiple channels for each qubit,
    or channels which operate on multiple qubits.

"""
    Drive(t)

The sum of all drive terms at a specific time `t`.

This represents the sum of each `Qubit(i)`,
    where `i` iterates over each drive term in the device.

For example, in a transmon device,
    `Drive(t)` might represent ``∑_q Ω_q(t) [\\exp(iν_qt) a_q + \\exp(-iν_qt) a_q']``.

"""
    Hamiltonian(t)

The full Hamiltonian at a specific time `t`.

"""
    Gradient(j,t)

An individual gradient operator (indexed by `j`) at a specific time `t`.

The gradient operators appear in the derivation of each gradient signal,
    which are used to calculate analytical gradients of each variational parameter.
The gradient operators are very closely related to individual channel operators,
    but sufficiently distinct that they need to be treated separately.

For example, for a transmon device,
    each channel operator ``Ω_q(t) [\\exp(iν_qt) a_q + \\exp(-iν_qt) a_q']``
    is associated with *two* gradient operators:
- ``\\exp(iν_qt) a_q + \\exp(-iν_qt) a_q'``
- ``i[\\exp(iν_qt) a_q - \\exp(-iν_qt) a_q']``
